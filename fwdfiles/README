Introduction

The scripts use Python 3 and R. The virtual enviroment already has all packages installed.

Use the standard virtual enviroment of Python to run the scripts:
$ source py3.6/bin/activate

All scripts are in:
$ cd py3.6/code
$ ls -lar

ScriptForecast.py is the main script to make forecasts. To learn how to use it:
$ python ScriptForecast.py -h

Obs.: There are lines of code inside the script to clean the data and select the region of interest (in the end of the file). In order to change the database, all these lines must be removed from the script.

The script writes a pickle file with the variables (clusters, realCrimes, forecasts) as a list.



**************
Code Structure
**************

Principal scripts:
ScriptForecast			main script
general_functions		general functions, function to add elapsed weeks/days/months, and to make the grid
custer_functions		clustering function module
forecast_*				each file implements one kind of forecast

Others:
syntax					related to the command line syntax of ScriptForecast



***********
Forecasting
***********

To understand the command line, use:

$ ./ScriptForecast -h

I didn't have time to update the syntax. Do not use the option -no_cluster.
If you don't want cluster, use 0 for the parameters 'threshold' and 'border'

Examples:

To use:
1 - forecasting AR(5)
2 - database 0-DPS_Original_Ajitesh.csv
3 - a grid 2x2 without cluster
4 - training with the first 150 weeks
5 - make forecasts for 3 weeks ahead

$ ./ScriptForecast.py -f_ar 0-DPS_Original_Ajitesh.csv 2 2 150 3 0 0

To use:
1 - forecasting AR(5)
2 - database 0-DPS_Original_Ajitesh.csv
3 - a grid 5x5 with cluster with threshold=5000 and border=1
4 - training with the first 150 weeks
5 - make forecasts for 3 weeks ahead

$ ./ScriptForecast.py -f_ar 0-DPS_Original_Ajitesh.csv 5 5 150 3 5000 1
